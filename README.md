# PunchAnyoneRevived

This mod aims to replicate PunchAnyone by haverdaden, though its source is written from scratch. The code can use some optimization and refactoring, I'll see when I can get to it.
This mod makes the following characters punchable:
- Teimo
- Fleetari
- Sewage guy
- Ventti dealer
- Grandma
- Drunk guys at pub
- Lindell
- Security guard
- Band members
- Dancers
- Jani
- Petteri
- Suski
- Bus driver
- Lantakari (strawberry guy)
- Septic tank NPCs
- Signe
- Markku
- Football kids
- Parts salesman
- Pena
- Uncle
- Theatre performers
- Jokke
- Kuski and passenger
